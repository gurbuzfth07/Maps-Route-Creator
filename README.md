# Maps-Route-Creator
This project helps to optimise routes based on stops using the OpenRouteService API.

Register at https://openrouteservice.org/ and generate an API key. 
Define the API key you created to ‘const apiKey = “YOUR_API_KEY”; ’ in the script.js file. 
Run the index.html file and add your stops so that the first selection is the start and the last selection is the end. 
Then optimise with the Create Route button.

Good luck...
